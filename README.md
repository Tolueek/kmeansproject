cluster molecular candidates (ligands) by straightforward physicochemical / docking-like descriptors to reveal groups that may correspond to chemotypes or binding behavior relevant to SARS-CoV-2 targets. The app expects 2+ numeric descriptors (e.g., predicted affinity, MW, logP, TPSA, HBD/HBA, rotatable bonds) and optionally a non-numeric reference column like target (Mpro, Spike RBD, PLpro, etc.) that is not used for clustering.
